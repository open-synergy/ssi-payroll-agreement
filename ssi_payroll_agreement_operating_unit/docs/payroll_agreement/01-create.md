# Create Payroll Agreement

> **Module:** ssi_payroll_agreement_operating_unit
>
> **Extends:** ssi_payroll_agreement — model `payroll_agreement`, aksi `01-create`

## Additional Fields

When this module is installed, the create form gains one additional field, visible only
to users in the **Multiple Operating Unit** group
(`operating_unit.group_multi_operating_unit`):

- **Operating Unit**: the operating unit that owns this payroll agreement document. Not
  required. Automatically filled from the current user's default operating unit (falls
  back to an operating unit assigned to the user in the active company, if any). Change
  if needed.

## Modified — Record Visibility

- The **Payroll Agreements** list is filtered by operating unit (record rule). A user
  only sees payroll agreement documents whose Operating Unit is one of the operating
  units assigned to them. This is not a Flow step.
